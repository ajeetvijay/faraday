# Faraday

This is the old location of Faraday.  Only the release tags will be synced here.

Faraday now lives at https://github.com/lostisland/faraday

## Change Your Remote

Pick your poison (https, ssh, git).  Replace `origin` with the name you use to
refer to `technoweenie/faraday`.

    $ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/lostisland/faraday
    $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:lostisland/faraday.git
    $ git remote set-url origin git://github.com/lostisland/faraday.git

## Host Your Own Faraday Repository

If you have a Faraday-related repository (middleware, adapters, etc), you are
more than welcome to host it under lostisland if you like.  You'll get full
push and administrative access of course.
